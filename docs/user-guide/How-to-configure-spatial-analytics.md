# How to Configure Spatial Analytics in Intel® SceneScape

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and use Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and Tripwires in Intel® SceneScape. By completing this guide, you will:

- Understand the differences between regions of interest and tripwires
- Learn how to configure ROIs and Tripwires through the UI
- Verify that events are properly triggered when objects interact with your defined analytics

---

## Prerequisites

Follow the steps in [Getting-Started-Guide.md](./Getting-Started-Guide.md) to bringup an instance of SceneScape with out-of-box demo scenes.

## Steps to Configure Regions of Interest

### 1. Understand Analytic Types

**Regions of Interest (ROIs)** are defined areas within a scene where you want to monitor object presence, count, and dwell time.
**Tripwires** are virtual lines that trigger events when objects cross them in either direction.

---

### 2. Configure and Use a Region of Interest

#### Create a Region of Interest

1. Log in to Intel® SceneScape.
2. Click on a scene.
3. Click on `Regions` tab at the bottom of the page.
4. Click `New Region` button to create a region.
5. Fill out `Name`, `Description`, and select the `Scene`.
6. Draw the region on the scene by clicking points to form a polygon.
7. **Optional**: Add a user-defined name for the ROI in the text box.
8. Click `Save Regions and Tripwires` to create the region.

#### Modify a Region of Interest

1. Click on `Regions` at the bottom of the page.
2. Find your region in the Scene and double click on the polygon to edit its shape.
3. Other properties of the region can also be edited in the region list.
4. Click `Save Regions and Tripwires` to persist your changes.

#### Verify the Results

1. Use a tool like MQTT Explorer to monitor the topic right under the region name text box. ex: /scenescape//event/region/${scene_uuid}/${region_uuid}/count
2. When an object enters, observe a message is received on that topic and it contains the following data:

### 3. Configure and Use a Tripwire

#### Create a Tripwire

1. Log in to Intel® SceneScape.
2. Click on a scene.
3. Click on `Tripwires` at the bottom of the page.
4. Click `New Tripwire` to create a tripwire.
5. Click on the Scene and a green line with two moveable endpoints will appear.
7. Click and drag each endpoint to get the right orientation and position for the tripwire.
8. **Optional**: Add a user-defined name for the tripwire in the textbox
9. Click `Save Regions and Tripwires` to create the tripwire.

#### Modify a Tripwire

1. Click on `Tripwires` at the bottom of the page.
2. Double click on the tripwire to edit on the scene.
3. Click and drag to change position and orientation.
4. Click `Save Regions and Tripwires` to persist your changes.

#### Verify the Results

1. Use a tool like MQTT Explorer to monitor the topic right under the tripwire name text box. ex: /scenescape//event/tripwire/${scene_uuid}/${tripwire_uuid}/objects
2. When an object walks through a tripwire, observe a message is received on that topic and it contains the following data:
